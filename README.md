# LazyAPI

## Serverless LLM Integration API

This project provides a serverless solution for integrating various large language models (LLMs) using JavaScript. It is designed to eliminate the need for individual developers to set up and manage their integration services for large models. With just a few lines of code, users can integrate and leverage the capabilities of multiple supported LLM APIs through a single standardized API call.
